My introductions to computer programming happened when I took a class in Java when I was back in school. In between schools, I've had various jobs that I wasn't really passionate about. From the get go, I liked the aspect of programming. It seemed similar to solving puzzles and I was intrigued by it. I liked the fact that I can bring my ideas to life through few lines of codes. I like learning new things and as for my understanding, a path to be  a good software engineer doesn't stop after a particular time period, it's  a continuous journey with learning and exploring new things along the way.

Unfortunately, my journey through the coding world came to a stop for a brief period of time because of some issues. But once I was over that, I started exploring and found tons of resources online. So I self taught myself basic html and CSS and took an algorithm class from various free online resources like codemy, Coursera etc.  I started visiting sites like codewars, codeninjas frequently. 

At that time I felt like I needed to learn a lot more and I realized I needed a structured learning environment. So I started looking and came to know about software bootcamps. I took a prep course in Javascript from an school and experienced for a little bit how the actual bootcamp would feel like. Me and my bootcamp prep cohorts did pair programming from day 1 and I loved the idea of collaborating with my peers as it presented opportunity for both of us to learn and solve problems in a dynamic way. 

I like the fact that through becoming a software engineer I'll get to do something I am really excited about and the cool and fun people I will get to work with. It was a fairly easy decision to make myself committed to try and become a software engineer and thus I joined the Software Engineering program at Flatiron School.
